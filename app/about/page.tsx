      <p className="mt-8">
        I’m Binaya Shrestha, a Computer Science student with a love for building
        things on the web. I enjoy working with modern technologies like React,
        Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to turn ideas into real-world
        projects.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8">
        Over the past few years, I’ve created apps ranging from a video-sharing
        platform to a CMS dashboard and even a music downloader. For me, every
        project is an opportunity to learn something new and solve real
        problems.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8">
        Outside of coding, I’m into music, art, and design, and I like
        collaborating with people who share the same curiosity for technology
        and creativity.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8">
        This blog is my space to share thoughts, experiments, and what I’m
        learning along the way.
